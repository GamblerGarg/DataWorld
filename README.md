# DataWorld
All shops have some sort of an electronic data collection and saving system be it in a printed or csv format. But these businesses cannot leverage this data to scale up or make better stocking decisions and such. 
 DataWorld, allows anyone without any kind of understanding of Data Science and statistics to use data generated by them to predict things that matter for their business. Then they are instructed to select the feature that they want predicted.
